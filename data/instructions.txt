ðŸ“œ THE RULES OF THE GAME ðŸ“œ

In this virtual board game, 2-6 players will battle against each other on
a star-shaped board. Your goal is to move all 10 of your colored marbles from 
your starting corner to the opposite corner.

During each turn, you can move one marble to one adjacent hole, or make one 
or more hops over adjacent marbles. You can move as many times as desired 
and valid, and then end your turn. At that point, the next player will go. Our 
game has two versions, easy and hard: hard mode only allows you to hop over one 
adjacent marble with each move, while easy mode allows you to hop over multiple 
marbles at once if they all lie along the direction specified.

To move a marble, format your command like so: 'move [marble number] [direction]'

The marble number is an integer 1-10 corresponding to the marble you wish to 
move. The direction is one of the following 6:

L (left)      LU (left up)      LD (left down)
R (right)     RU (right up)     RD (right down)

As an example, if you want to move your marble 05 to the left, you would input:
'move 05 L'

You may quit the game at anytime by entering 'quit'
